  は "An APPROPRIATE architectural decision ..." (適切な選択をすべき) なのか,
  "... must be made FIRST to determine ..."
  (まずアーキテクチャが決まらないと...) なのか?

- "The includes consideration for ..." はどう直すべき?

- なんでこんな分りづらい表現してるの? FIPS からとってきてる?

  "In addition, the cryptomodule must be installed, configured, and
   operated in either an approved or an allowed mode to provide a high
   degree of certainty that the FIPS 140-2 validated cryptomodule is
   providing the expected security services in the expected manner."
