1.11 Yes, it's a repetition, but it's almost okay as I want it to be
expansively inclusive. If you want to make it shorter in Japanese, the
following phrasing is perfectly fine:

"Verify that all application components, libraries, modules, framework,
platform, and operating system are free from known vulnerabilities."

5.18 Yes, I expect both to be used in well written apps, with server side
validation being essential, and client side being nice for user experience.

7.11 はい、そです。

7.13 / 9.11 / 17.10 - yes, but different aspects of exactly the same risk

- Crypto - it's about clearing out encryption keys and passwords (this is
the mimikatz threat)
- Data protection - it's about clearing out sensitive / personal
information (this is the data breach threat)
- Mobile - it's about clearing out oAuth / authentication tokens from
memory as well as other secrets (this is the data loss of a phone / evil
maid threat)

The mechanism to protect against these are identical in nature, and thus
more or less the same phrasing.

Excellent pick ups! I will look into the corruption issue in Appendix A
tomorrow.

度もありがとございます

thanks
Andrew
